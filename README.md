# SlickPic: An Example For Multiple Image Selection

This project was born from the idea that you should be able to take multiple pictures and also select pictures from you camera roll.

This is NOT a maintained library. It serves to show as an example how to create your own version of a multi-image picker using both the Camer2 and first Camera API.
